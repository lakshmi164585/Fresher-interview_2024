# aws complete interview questions and answers for freshers 

What is AWS?
# Answer: AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services for computing, storage, networking, databases, machine learning, and more, enabling businesses to scale and deploy applications globally.
What are the key components of AWS?
# Answer: Key components of AWS include EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for virtual servers, S3 (Simple Storage Service) for object storage, RDS (Relational Database Service) for managed databases, Lambda for serverless computing, and VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for network isolation.
What is an EC2 instance?
# Answer: An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the cloud that provides computing power, allowing users to run applications, host websites, and perform various tasks. Instances can be configured with different CPU, memory, storage, and networking options.
Explain the difference between S3 and EBS.
# Answer: S3 is object storage used for storing and retrieving data like files and multimedia, accessible over HTTP/HTTPS. EBS provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances, acting like a hard drive attached to the instance.
What is a VPC in AWS?
# Answer: VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network that you define within AWS. It allows you to create isolated sections of the AWS cloud, including subnets, route tables, and internet gateways, providing control over network resources and security.
What is Auto Scaling?
# Answer: Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in a group based on demand or predefined metrics. It helps maintain application performance, availability, and cost efficiency by scaling in during low traffic and scaling out during high traffic.
How do you secure data in AWS?
